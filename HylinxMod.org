** basket
*** what is my goal or intention?
to create a set of factions, planets, and missions for a plant civilization in Endless Sky
*** why am I doing this?
for fun! Also I think it would be really novel, and would add a lot to ES. And I love ES!
*** what do I already know about this project?
**** lore
- The Hylinx are a group of species of plants, fungi, and a few sessile animals that originate from Sawi and have developed an interstellar civilization.
- species
  - Violetstalk
    - enviroment: Tundra
    - reproduction: spreads pollen by either by air or by insect; decides on which based on instincts and sometimes deliberate choice. the pollen reaches the partner plant and the flower turns into a fruit, which is eaten by the "pets" of the Violetstalk and the seeds inside go out with the dung and enter the environment...
    - growth:
      - embryo: not sentient at this stage
      - sapling: sentient for the first time. the forest will often attempt to establish connections to them to teach them and train them. for example, if a sapling is near a potential river, the forest may teach the sapling to dam it and store it somehow. the forest may also teach a sapling how to catch food.
      - adolescent: physically and mentally mature enough at this point to start doing some of the forest's work, though is still in training. but the barriers between adolescence and adulthood are blurry...
      - adulthood: starts doing the work lol
    - social structure
      - Violetstalk usually have up to 216 relations, though they usually only have 30 to 50 close relations.
      - Violetstalk usually unite into polities like us humans
    - family structure
      - Violetstalk don't choose mates (since insects or birds do their pollination work for them) but they do childcare since each child is costly! Childcare is mainly feeding, nurturing, and teaching. Teaching is as described above.
      - Childcare is collective.
   - diet
     - whatever the Maw digests.
     - stuff from the soil
   - challenges
     - managing land, especially in new habitats that they break into
     - keeping their animals in their favour
     - protecting their animals from predators
     - domesticating the animals
     - cooperating with themselves and other animals
  - Mawsters
    - protosapient macro-fungi species that lays traps
    - diet
      - small birds... which the Violetstalk unfortunately needs! Violetstalk have found ways to stop  Mawsters from eating them
      - some land animals
      - smaller organisms, like bacteria and even plankton in certain habitats
   - environment: tundra, like the Violetstalk
   - reproduction: meets with other mycellia to create mushrooms, which release spores, which land on a suitable substrate (perhaps simply a damp spot, but usually a piece of bark or wet soil)
   - social structure
     - only around 60 relations!
   - family structure
     - little to none; Mawsters don't give a damn about their children, because they are largely expendable
   - challenges
 - Eyed Vines
   - eyes, good for seeing
     - what might they use these eyes for, though?
     - probably to see where it is best to grow? but doesn't chemosense do that better?
   - environment:
 - Sporadic
    - smaller fungus, capable of sending spores to hijack the brains of animals to do its bidding, and directly commanding them
- things to flesh out for species
  - environment
  - reproduction
  - growth
  - social structure
  - family structure
  - challenges
  - diet
- gotta get feedback on this!
  - maybe ask about Intelligent Plants on OA
- botanopsychology
*** what don't I know that I need to find out?
- what conditions would lead to sapient plants?
- is this a good fit for Endless Sky? ask in Github
*** what can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?
- Semiosis & Interference
- web lol
*** who can I talk to who might provide insights?
