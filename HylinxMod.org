* TODO "Hylinx Mod" [0%]
:PROPERTIES:
:ORDERED:  t
:END:
** what is my goal or intention?
to create a set of factions, planets, and missions for a plant civilization in Endless Sky that is worthy of being included in the main game!
** why am I doing this?
for fun! Also I think it would be really novel, and would add a lot to ES. And I love ES! and also for validation
** basket
*** what do I already know about this project?
**** lore
- The Hylinx are a group of species of plants, fungi, and a few sessile animals that originate from Sawi and have developed an interstellar civilization.
- species
  - Eyed Vines
    - eyes, good for seeing
      - what might they use these eyes for, though?
      - probably to see where it is best to grow? but doesn't chemosense do that better?
    - environment:
  - Sporadic
    - smaller fungus, capable of sending spores to hijack the brains of animals to do its bidding, and directly commanding them
- things to flesh out for species
  - environment
  - reproduction
  - growth
  - social structure
  - family structure
  - challenges
  - diet
- gotta get feedback on this!
  - maybe ask about Intelligent Plants on OA
- botanopsychology
*** what don't I know that I need to find out?
- what conditions would lead to sapient plants?
- is this a good fit for Endless Sky? ask in Github
*** what can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?
- Semiosis & Interference
- web lol
*** who can I talk to who might provide insights?
** another basket: more stuff
*** what is my goal or intention?
create content (systems, ships, and lore) for ES that introduces a plant civilization
*** what do I already know about this project?
- I should check out Semiosis and Interference
- species that I want to add
  - Violetstalk
    -
  - Sporadic
  - Eyed Vines
- factions that I want to add
  - Klava
  - HyFed
  - HyCorps
- things to flesh out
  - environment
    - territory
    - resources available
  - economics
    - needs
    - imports

  - politics
    - governance structure
    - goals

  - relationships
  - culture
    - values
    - anti-values
- what I should flesh out for each species
  - habitat
  - defense
  - diet
  - senses
  - reproduction
*** what don't I know that I need to find out?
- I didn't do this one last time; I must now.
- what is the best way to flesh out alien species?
  - I already know, to some extent, how to make alien species, but I am wondering what the best ways are. Definitely worth investing research!
- can this ever fit in ES? if it doesn't fit in ES, will it still be good?
- is the territory anticlockwise of the Remnant up for grabs for aspiring ES contributors?
*** what can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?
- Modmaking
- Alien Species Making
- any other pieces of media on intelligent plants
*** who can I talk to who might provide insights?
- I should definitely VERY much talk to the Endless Sky community about this. maybe over on Discord?
