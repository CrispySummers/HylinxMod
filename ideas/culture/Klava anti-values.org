#+title: Klava Anti-Values
Given the challenges that the Klava have faced, what things would they look down upon or even attack in order to protect themselves?

- any values from the cultures that make them up?
- any values they have in general?
  - naivety
  - double crossing  
  - selfishness  
  - letting your guard down TOO much  
  - limiting your potential
  - being too attached to your "sense of self"  
  - secrecy
    - the Klava might interpret this as signs of a conspiracy brewing  
  - maybe organized religion?
  - heavy disruption, unless to counteract a genuine injustice
  - arrogance
