#+title: Interceptor Ideas
Alright, I have no idea what Interceptors are good for, but I'll make some anyways.

I think they are mainly good for swarming and overwhelming? Thus, I'll make Hylinx interceptors fast and manouverable

- a long range, low armor, but fast interceptor
- a short range, high armor, and fast interceptor

alright, I'll take a look at the interceptors of humans, and other species

- Hylinx general purpose
- faction-specific
  - HyFed
  - Consortium
  - Klava
  - Verota
