#+title: Jobs
Alright, for this brainstorming session, I'll come up with 10 kinds of jobs. After all, this task will take 10 minutes...

- Simple courier missions: carrying cargo or passengers
- Hylinx general missions
  - prisoner transport
  - what else can I come up with? let's think of what the other factions already have...
    - maybe special kinds of courier missions?
      - like GM seeds?
      - 
  - tech retrieval
  - collaborators
  - escort (not from pirates, but from enemy governments...)  
- Faction-specific missions
  - Consortium
    - Corporate Espionage?
      - the Consortium might find using a foreigner like the player to scan rival ships to be useful, as rival ships might simply think that it is alien curiosity
    - Weapon Testing?
  - Verota
    - Pilgrimage?
    - Test of purity (of the PC)?  
  - HyFed    
  - Klava
    - Weapon Testing?
    - Mind Testing?
