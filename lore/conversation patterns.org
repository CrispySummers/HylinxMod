#+title: Conversation Patterns
The Hylinx communicate primarily through chemicals, though sometimes also through electrical signals when they need to send something fast.

Thus, when your translator translates their languages to English, what you get will:
- Be logical, structured, specific, and commanding, though containing metaphor. E.g "If you want to strengthen your relationship with us, join us for our feast." instead of the usual human "Wanna join us for dinner?"
- Contain emotion tags (representing things that humans and other sapient animal species usually communicate with body language) in square brackets. e.g [angry], [indignant], [pleasure], [curious], [sad]
