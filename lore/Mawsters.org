- Mawsters
  - protosapient macro-fungi species that lays traps
  - diet
    - small birds... which the Violetstalk unfortunately needs! Violetstalk have found ways to stop  Mawsters from eating them
    - some land animals
    - smaller organisms, like bacteria and even plankton in certain habitats
  - environment: tundra, like the Violetstalk
    - reproduction: meets with other mycellia to create mushrooms, which release spores, which land on a suitable substrate (perhaps simply a damp spot, but usually a piece of bark or wet soil)
    - social structure
      - only around 60 relations!
    - family structure
      - little to none; Mawsters don't give a damn about their children, because they are largely expendable
    - challenges
