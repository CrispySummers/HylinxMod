        `Minutes after entering this system, a nearby alien ship sends a transmission made up of binary pulses. You work furiously to decode it. After minutes of brute force, you see that it is a grayscale 256x256 image with lots of detail: 10 different plant species with 5 individuals for each, a long line of pixels made up of only 4 different shades of grey, images of many jewels, and a starmap. The starmap seems to complete your own starmap of this place. And one of the star systems on it is emphasized by underlines. It appears that these aliens want to talk.`

        `The alien ship sends another image, this time more abstract. It appears to be about the relationships between objects. One part shows a wilted plant, water droplet, and a grown plant, with an abstract symbol between them. Another shows a spaceship, fire, and yet another symbol. There are many more parts like this.`
        `The conversation continues, and after a few hours, you and the aliens seem to have developed a pidgin of images. But you don't know how to communicate further. It is clear that you will need the help of a diplomatic team.`
